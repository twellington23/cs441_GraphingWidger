# cs441_GraphingWidget
Graphing Widget (Android Surface) Project

(THIS APP DOES NOT WORK AS INTENDED YET)

This custom graphing widget is meant to visualize the rate of interest on an investment. The user can use the EditText box to input the annual rate of interest. Then, when the user presses the graph action button, a graph will be generated showing a line representing the growth of your investment over the next few years based on the rate of interest.

To use the app, first input the rate of interest in the EditText box next to "Rate of Interest = ". After this, tap on the black area on screen (the Surface View) to draw the default grid on the screen. Finally, tap the graph action button in the bottom right corner to generate the line on the graph representing the growth of your investment (the app currently crashes when this button is pressed).
