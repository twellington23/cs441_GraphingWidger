Graphing Widget (Android Surface) Project

(THIS APP DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY YET)

This custom graphing widget is meant to visualize the rate of interest on an investment. The user can input the amount of money they are investing and the annual rate of interest. Then, when the user presses the graph action button, a graph will be generated showing a line representing the growth of your invested money over the next few years.
